  </div>
    <p>
        
            <h2>Early Life and Education:</h2>
Dr. Gagandeep Kang was born on 3 November 1962 in Shimla, India. She pursued her medical education at Christian Medical College (CMC), Vellore, earning her MBBS in 1987 and MD in Microbiology in 1991. She later completed her PhD in 1998 and did post-doctoral research with Mary K. Estes at Baylor College of Medicine, USA. Her early training laid a strong foundation for her career in enteric infections and vaccine research.

            <h2>Career and Leadership:</h2>
Dr. Kang began her career by building long-term community birth cohorts in and around Vellore, linking epidemiology, immunology, and virology to study diarrheal diseases. She served as Executive Director of the Translational Health Science and Technology Institute (THSTI), Faridabad from 2016 to 2020. In 2019, she was elected Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS), becoming the first Indian woman scientist working in India to receive this honor. Since 2023, she has been leading the Enterics, Diagnostics, Genomics & Epidemiology (EDGE) portfolio at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, while maintaining strong ties with CMC, Vellore.

            <h2>Scientific Contributions:</h2>
Dr. Kang is best known for her pioneering work on rotavirus and other enteric infections. She demonstrated the high disease burden and genetic diversity of rotavirus in India and explained why oral vaccines sometimes perform less effectively in low-resource settings. Her research directly contributed to the development and national introduction of Rotavac and Rotasiil vaccines. She also co-led typhoid surveillance networks, informing the use of typhoid conjugate vaccines. Her work spans community birth cohorts, viral genomics, immune correlates, and environmental drivers of disease, creating models widely used in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

            <h2>Publications and Books:</h2>
Dr. Kang has authored over 300 scientific papers and served as editor for journals including Tropical Medicine & International Health and PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases. She co-edited Manson’s Textbook of Tropical Medicine, becoming the first Indian and first woman editor. She also co-authored “Till We Win: India’s Fight Against the COVID-19 Pandemic”, a public-health text widely referenced during the pandemic.

            <h2>Policy and Global Health Roles:</h2>
Dr. Kang has served on WHO advisory committees, including the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety and regional immunization groups. In India, she has advised NTAGI and national task forces on immunization and child health. She has also contributed to global health governance as a board member of CEPI and advisor to institutions like the Graduate Institute in Geneva.

            <h2>Awards and Recognition:</h2>
Her achievements have been recognized with prestigious awards, including the Infosys Prize in Life Sciences (2016), Fellow of the Royal Society (2019), and the Canada Gairdner Global Health Award (2024). These honors highlight her significant contributions to enteric disease research, vaccine development, and child health.

            <h2>Impact of Her Work:</h2>
Dr. Kang’s research has directly influenced vaccine policy and implementation in India and globally. By integrating laboratory science, clinical studies, and community research, she has helped protect millions of children through vaccines and improved understanding of enteric diseases in low-resource settings. Her work remains a model for combining scientific excellence with public health impact.</p>
