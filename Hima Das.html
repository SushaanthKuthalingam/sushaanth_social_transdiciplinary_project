    <h2>Early Life and Education:</h2>
    Hima Das was born on 9 January 2000 in Kandhulimari village, near Dhing in Assam’s Nagaon district. She came from
    a humble background — her father Ranjit Das was a rice farmer, and her mother Jonali Das managed the household.
    Growing up in rural Assam, Hima initially played football with boys in muddy fields, showing extraordinary speed and
    stamina. Her natural athletic ability soon caught the attention of local coaches, who guided her towards sprinting.

    <h2>Entry into Athletics</h2>
    Despite limited facilities and financial challenges, Hima’s determination and her family’s support helped her train
    seriously. She was spotted by coaches at the Assam Sports College, who helped polish her raw talent. Within a few
    years, she began competing at national-level events and quickly became known for her explosive pace on the track.

    <h2>Career Highlights</h2>
    Hima’s big breakthrough came in 2018, when she won the gold medal in the 400m event at the IAAF World Under-20
    Championships in Finland, becoming the first Indian woman to win a gold medal in a world athletics event. Later the
    same year, she won silver medals in the 400m and 4x400m relay at the Asian Games in Jakarta, cementing her place as
    one of India’s fastest sprinters.

    <h2>Challenges & Struggles</h2>
    Coming from a modest family background, Hima faced difficulties in getting proper training facilities, equipment,
    and exposure during her early years. Even after her international success, she battled recurring injuries that often
    interrupted her training and competitions. Still, her resilience and fighting spirit kept her in the spotlight as
    one of India’s brightest athletics talents.

    <h2>Recognition & Awards</h2>
    For her achievements, Hima Das was conferred with the Arjuna Award in 2018. She also became a Deputy Superintendent
    of Police (DSP) in Assam Police, an honor that reflected both her sporting excellence and her inspirational journey.

    <h2>Personal Life & Legacy</h2>
    Nicknamed the “Dhing Express” after her hometown, Hima remains an icon for young athletes in India, particularly
    from rural areas. Her story of overcoming poverty, limited resources, and societal challenges to achieve global
    recognition continues to motivate aspiring sportspersons across the country.
