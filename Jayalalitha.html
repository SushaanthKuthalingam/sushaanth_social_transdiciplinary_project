    </div>
    <p>
    <h2>Early Life & Background</h2>

    Jayalalithaa Jayaraman was born on 24 February 1948 in Mysore (now in Karnataka). She lost her father at a young
    age, and her mother, Sandhya, moved to Chennai to work as an actress to support the family. Jayalalithaa was
    academically gifted, excelling in school, and was trained in classical dance and music. However, financial struggles
    after her father’s death pushed her towards a career in films to support her family.

    <h2>Entry into Cinema</h2>

    Jayalalithaa entered the Tamil film industry in the 1960s and quickly rose to fame with her beauty, talent, and
    versatility. She acted in over 140 films, mainly in Tamil, Telugu, and Kannada, and became one of the most popular
    actresses of her time. She worked alongside legendary actors such as M.G. Ramachandran (MGR), who later played a
    major role in shaping her political journey.

    <h2>Transition to Politics</h2>

    Under the mentorship of MGR, Jayalalithaa joined the AIADMK (All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam) party in the
    1980s. Initially facing resistance as a woman in politics, she gradually established herself as a powerful orator
    and leader. After MGR’s death in 1987, she took over the party leadership, overcoming internal opposition and gender
    bias to rise to prominence.

    <h2>Political Career & Achievements</h2>

    Jayalalithaa served as the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu six times between 1991 and 2016, becoming the state’s first
    woman to hold the position. Her governance was marked by populist welfare schemes such as Amma Canteens, Amma Water,
    and Amma Pharmacies, which provided affordable food and services to the poor. She was admired as a strong
    administrator who modernized infrastructure, promoted education, and improved healthcare in Tamil Nadu.

    <h2>Challenges & Struggles</h2>

    Her political career was not without controversy. Jayalalithaa faced multiple corruption charges and was even
    imprisoned for a brief period. Despite these challenges, her popularity with the masses remained strong, and she
    earned the affectionate title “Amma” (Mother) from her supporters, who saw her as a protector and provider.

    <h2>Personal Life & Legacy</h2>

    Jayalalithaa remained unmarried throughout her life and dedicated herself to public service. She passed away on 5
    December 2016 in Chennai after prolonged illness, leaving behind a lasting legacy in both cinema and politics. She
    is remembered as a trailblazer who broke barriers in a male-dominated political world and transformed Tamil Nadu’s
    welfare landscape.
