			<h2>Early Life & Education</h2>

			Mithali Dorai Raj was born on 3 December 1982 in Jodhpur, Rajasthan. Her father, Dorai Raj, was an officer with the Indian Air Force, and her mother, Leela Raj, worked with the engineering instruments division of Lawrence and Mayo. Initially, Mithali was trained in classical dance (Bharatanatyam), but her parents soon recognized her talent for cricket and encouraged her to pursue the sport seriously. By the age of 10, she was already part of cricket coaching camps, often being the only girl among boys.

			<h2>Entry into Cricket</h2>

			Mithali Raj’s journey into cricket began in her childhood when she used to accompany her elder brother to his cricket coaching sessions. Initially, she had little interest in the sport, but her natural talent for batting was soon noticed by her coach. She trained at the Keyes Girls High School in Secunderabad and later at St. John’s Coaching Foundation, where her skills quickly developed.

At just 16 years old, she made her debut for the Indian women’s cricket team in 1999, scoring an unbeaten 114 runs against Ireland. This stunning entry into international cricket announced her arrival as a prodigy and laid the foundation for her legendary career.

			<h2>Career Highlights	</h2>

			Over the next two decades, Mithali Raj became the backbone of Indian women’s cricket. She captained the Indian team in multiple ICC World Cups and led them to the finals in 2005 and 2017, earning global recognition for women’s cricket in India. She is widely regarded as one of the greatest women cricketers of all time, holding the record for the highest run-scorer in women’s ODIs with over 7,800 runs. Known for her elegant stroke play, she was often compared to some of the finest male cricketers for her technique and temperament.

			<h2>Challenges & Achievements</h2>

			Coming from a time when women’s cricket had little financial or social support in India, Mithali faced numerous struggles, including limited training facilities and lack of visibility for the women’s game. Despite these obstacles, her persistence and consistent performances brought both respect and recognition to women’s cricket. She became a symbol of resilience, inspiring thousands of young girls to take up the sport.

			<h2>Retirement & Legacy</h2>

			Mithali Raj announced her retirement from international cricket in June 2022, concluding an illustrious 23-year career. She continues to contribute to the game as a mentor and commentator, and she was also involved with the Women’s Premier League (WPL) in its early stages. Her life and career have even inspired the biographical film Shabaash Mithu, which highlights her struggles and achievements.</p>
