			<h2>Early Life & Education</h2>

			Nigar Shaji was born in 1964 in Sengottai, a town in Tamil Nadu’s Tenkasi district, into a Tamil Muslim family. Her father, Sheikh Meeran, was a mathematics graduate who later became a farmer, while her mother, Saitoon Beevi, was a homemaker. With their encouragement, she excelled in her studies, topping her district in Class 10 and her school in Class 12. She went on to pursue engineering in Electronics and Communications from the Government College of Engineering, Tirunelveli, and later completed her Master’s in Electronics from the Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra, Ranchi.

			<h2>Entry into ISRO & Career Journey</h2>

			In 1987, Nigar Shaji joined the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre. She began her career as a spacecraft test engineer and gradually rose through the ranks, contributing to a variety of remote-sensing, communication, and planetary satellite projects. She also played a key role as Associate Project Director for Resourcesat-2A, a satellite used for monitoring Earth’s natural resources.

			<h2>Leadership of Aditya-L1 Mission</h2>

			Nigar Shaji became the Project Director of Aditya-L1, India’s first space-based solar observatory. The mission, launched on September 2, 2023, was designed to study the Sun and its influence on Earth’s climate and space weather. Since around 2016, she oversaw the integration of seven advanced scientific instruments developed by different research institutions, and ensured the smooth coordination between engineers and scientists. Her leadership was central to the success of this landmark mission.

			<h2>Views on Gender Equity & Mentorship
			</h2>

			Throughout her career, Shaji has often highlighted that ISRO works on a merit-based system where talent and dedication matter more than gender. She has encouraged young women, especially those from small towns and rural backgrounds, to believe in their abilities and pursue careers in science and technology. Her story is seen as a strong message of empowerment and mentorship for the next generation.

			<h2>Current Role & Legacy</h2>

			Today, Nigar Shaji serves as Associate Director, Projects, at the U.R. Rao Satellite Centre, where she oversees multiple spacecraft programs. She also holds the role of Programme Director for low Earth orbit and planetary missions, and has been involved in studies for India’s upcoming Venus mission and proposed exoplanet exploration projects. Her work continues to push the frontiers of Indian space science.

			<h2>Personal Life & Recognition</h2>

			She currently resides in Bengaluru with her mother and daughter, while her husband works in Dubai and her son is a scientist in the Netherlands. For her pioneering contributions, she has been recognized with several honors, including the “Eve of Excellence” award in 2023.</p>
