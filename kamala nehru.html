       <h2> Early Life & Background</h2>

Kamala Nehru was born on 1 August 1899 in Delhi into a Kashmiri Brahmin family. She was married at the age of 17 to Jawaharlal Nehru, who later became the first Prime Minister of India. Coming from a traditional background, she initially led a quiet domestic life but gradually became drawn into the Indian independence movement through her husband’s political involvement.

<h2>Entry into the Freedom Struggle</h2>

Influenced by Mahatma Gandhi’s call for women’s participation in the struggle, Kamala Nehru stepped into public life. She actively worked during the Non-Cooperation Movement (1920–22), encouraging women across the country to join the freedom struggle. She organized women’s groups to picket shops selling foreign cloth and liquor, and promoted the use of khadi, becoming an important voice in mobilizing Indian women.

<h2>Role in India’s Independence Movement</h2>

During times when Jawaharlal Nehru was imprisoned for political activities, Kamala Nehru often took his place at public meetings, addressing crowds and keeping the spirit of resistance alive. Her courage and dedication made her a respected figure within the Congress movement. She also worked for women’s education and empowerment, helping to inspire many women to come out of traditional confines and participate in nation-building.

<h2>Personal Life & Struggles</h2>

Kamala Nehru’s health was fragile for much of her life, and she often suffered from illnesses. Despite her health challenges, she remained committed to public service and political activism. She was also a supportive mother to Indira Gandhi, who would later become India’s first woman Prime Minister.

<h2>Death & Legacy</h2>

Kamala Nehru passed away on 28 February 1936 in Lausanne, Switzerland, after battling tuberculosis. Though she lived a short life, her contribution to the freedom struggle and women’s empowerment was significant. She is remembered as a strong yet gentle figure who balanced family responsibilities with her dedication to India’s independence.
